# OHMS Embed

An Omeka Classic module that allows site administrators to add [Oral History Metadata Synchronizer](https://www.oralhistoryonline.org/) objects as media to Omeka S items.

This module will add an OHMS viewer to places where media can be embedded, allowing users to view indexes, transcripts, and/or translations of videos and audio as they are played. To build OHMS objects you will need an OHMS account. For more information, see the manual and the [OHMS website](https://www.oralhistoryonline.org/).
